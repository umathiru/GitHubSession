step 1: get main parent
step 2: get child of parent who has no left child & parent=main parent
	2a: get child of parent who has no left child & parent=child parent
step 3: get child of parent who has left child as step 2 left child id & parent=main parent
step 4: get child of parent who has left child as step 3 left child id & parent=main parent & no right child
